## Overview

Tarot Truth & Dare reimagines the traditional party game into a refined, atmospheric digital experience. Instead of a basic random picker, this application presents a three-card tarot spread with animated reveal effects and a dark, ritual-inspired interface.

The application supports large statement datasets (1000+ entries) stored in Supabase or a local JSON deck and ensures randomized selection for each draw.

*   **Truth / Dare selection mode** (Moon Path / Flame Path)
*   **Randomized statement selection** (Supabase RPC integration)
*   **Large scalable statement dataset support**
*   **Responsive layout**
*   **GitHub Pages deployment ready**

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
*   HTML5

## Random Selection Logic

Random statement selection is handled either by:
*   **Supabase RPC** using `ORDER BY random() LIMIT 1`
*   **Local JSON deck** with in-memory non-repeating selection logic

The system is designed to scale to 2000+ entries while maintaining performance.

## Future Improvements

*   Difficulty-based filtering (easy / normal / savage)
*   Category-based tarot spread
*   Session-based no-repeat logic
*   Multiplayer support
*   Audio ambience layer
*   Admin dashboard for statement management
